//HOW TO UPLOAD PROJECT TO GITHUB
//IT WILL ASK YOU TO LOG INTO GITHUB BEFORE SHARING ON YOUR FIRST REPOSITORY SHARE
//ONCE YOU MAKE A CHANGE AND WANT TO REUPLOAD (COMMIT AND PUSH), DO THE FOLLOWING

//I am making an edit to show how to pull updates from github to the local project. This is normally done to transfer code from one device to another.
//You first push from the device with the most up to date code, and then pull from a device that you want to have the code on. I will now
//save this change and pull it into CLion.
